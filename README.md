Notifications (via Telegram): For this to work, I have used ngrok to publicly expose my local development server, so as to be able to register a webhook with the telegram API to receive any new messages to my bot. In addition, I am making sure that users cannot login to the system unless they have registered with their info in the system, verified their email address, and subscribed to the telegram bot.
</li>

<li>
Categories
</li>

<li>
Internationalization (part I): Added support for 4 languages (English, Arabic, Spanish, and French), with English being the default.
</li>

<li>
Internationalization (part II): Added support for 4 currencies (US dollar, Euro, Japanese yen, and Pound sterling), with the dollar being the default.
</li>

<li>
Performance Optimization (part I): Utilized redis as the caching driver for caching the response from the exchange rate API, I am caching it for 1 hour, since the exchange rate is fluctuating. In addition, I have added full text indexes to products and categories table to make search operations more efficient, and lastly, I have used redis as a queue driver for sending Telegram notifications. I have monitored the performance before and after each step and it shows decrease in response times.
</li>

<li>
Performance Optimization (part II): Updated search queries to use elasticsearch, installed using docker-compose with three nodes cluster.
</li>

<li>
Analytics: Utilized Kibana of the ELK stack to create visualizations of the data residing in the elastic search.
</li>

</ul>
