Notifications (via Telegram): For this to work, I have used ngrok to publicly expose my local development server, so as to be able to register a webhook with the telegram API to receive any new messages to my bot. In addition, I am making sure that users cannot login to the system unless they have registered with their info in the system, verified their email address, and subscribed to the telegram bot.
